# Queries Management System - Quick Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Updates**
- Updated `SimpleQuery` model in Prisma schema to include:
  - `updatedAt` field for tracking modifications
  - `status` field (NEW, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED, CLOSED)
  - `notes` field for admin comments
  - Optional `userId` for non-authenticated submissions
- Created migration: `20260220_add_query_management`

### 2. **API Endpoints Created**

#### `/api/contact/route.ts` (POST & GET)
- **POST:** Submit new queries from contact form
- **GET:** Retrieve only the logged-in user's queries

#### `/api/queries/[queryId]/route.ts` (GET, PATCH, DELETE)
- **GET:** Admin views all queries or specific query
- **PATCH:** Admin updates query status and notes
- **DELETE:** Admin deletes queries

### 3. **Customer Pages**

#### `/your-queries/page.tsx`
- Shows only the logged-in customer's queries
- Displays status with color coding
- Shows submission date and last updated date
- Provides status updates/messages
- Requires login to access

### 4. **Admin Pages**

#### `/queries/page.tsx`
- Shows all customer queries (admin only)
- Filter queries by status (ALL, NEW, IN_PROGRESS, RESOLVED, CLOSED)
- Edit queries: Update status and add admin notes
- Delete queries
- Shows customer contact information
- Shows linked user account details
- Only accessible to admin (harsh.141615.gmail.com)

### 5. **Updated Components**

#### Navbar.tsx
- Added navigation links to "Your Queries" for logged-in users
- Added "Manage All Queries" for admin
- Updated mobile menu with query navigation options
- Admin email verification for role checking

#### Footer.tsx
- Contact form already using `/api/contact` endpoint
- Submits queries to database
- Associates query with logged-in user (if authenticated)

### 6. **Access Control**
- Customers can only see their own queries
- Admin (harsh.141615.gmail.com) can see all queries
- All endpoints have proper authentication/authorization checks
- Unauthorized access returns 401 status

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server

```

### Step 3: Test the System
